My name is Denay Stokely, and I am a 3rd-year Computer Science major, also minoring in Political Science. I have some research experience as I am a Political Science Research Assistant. 
Most of my courses have been in C++, Assembly (ASM), and Python, but I have studied principles of Java, R, SQL, HTML, and CSS. I have worked with MIPS, LINUX and on various operating systems. 

From my research in Political Science, I have been able to develop skills like time management, teamwork, problem-solving, and critical thinking. 
From my time on my school's orientation team, I have gained leadership and adaptability skills 
From my peer educator job, I have been able to gain better ways of communicating verbally and via text, creativity, and empathy 

My best project that I have been able to make was my first project I was able to do without any help. This project was coded for withdrawals and deposits from a bank. In this project, it shows different aspects of what I learn in my first year with menus, arrays (adding and taking away),
Another project that I made was a way to organize songs using apps and websites like Spotify. 

I have completed multiple certificates and simulations in cybersecurity and am still looking forward to completing more. 
The ones that I currently have are the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, IBM Cybersecurity courses, and the MasterCard Cybersecurity Awareness Team Simulation
